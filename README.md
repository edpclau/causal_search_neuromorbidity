# Preliminary Causal Discovery for Biomarkers Influencing the Risk of Acquiring Neuromorbidities in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU)

## Description

In this repository you will find code nessary to understand how we performed the causal discovery in our paper and how we evaluated the resulting causal graphs.

### Code
The "causal_ml_12hours" jupyter notebook describes how we performed the causal search.
The "graph_eval" notebook contains the results of our DAG evaluation.

### Expert Knowledge
The "Expert and Graph Agreement" excel file contains the results for each clinician collaborator and how we assessed agreement. The reader
should be able to replicate our "Clinician Consensus" graph using this data.

### Figures
Supplementary figures for the paper. It includes the full PC and FCI graphs.
